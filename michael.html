        <h2>About me</h2>
        <hr>
        <h4>What courses do you teach?</h4>
        <p>I teach Client-Side Web Development and Server-Side Web Development for the IMD program.</p>
        <h4>Where did you go to school university, college, etc.)?</h4>
        <p> I attended Iowa State University</p>
        <h4>Why did you become a teacher?</h4>
        <p> I am largely self-taught and constantly striving to learn more. The field of web design and development is
          ever-changing and if you don’t keep moving, you will fall behind. It is this realization that lead me to
          start teaching at Algonquin College in January of 2016. I have a passion for learning and it fuels my desire
          to share what I know with others. It has become my new passion, and my primary focus. I aim to be the best
          teacher I can, and it is my hope that my students will find the same spark of curiosity that changed my life
          all those years ago.</p>
        <h4>How many years have you been a teacher?</h4>
        <p>I have been teaching for almost 3 years.</p>
        <h4>Is there anything you wish you taught but can't? </h4>
        <p>
          There are a lot of topics and information I wish I
          could teach. Web Development is a vast field and there is
          so much that can be learned and taught. But unfortunately,
          there is only so much time. But specifically, I would like to teach
          more CSS. I really enjoy how CSS mixes the worlds of logic and design.
        </p>
        <h6>Advice for future students: </h6>
        <p>
          Don’t be afraid of new things and embrace change.
          In this field, things are changing all the time,
          and there is a constant array of new things to learn.
          You can choose to sit by the sidelines or you can be the
          one who is riding the wave.
