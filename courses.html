            Design Thinking uses a designer mindset to produce business innovations in products and services,
            with a focus on deep understanding of and empathy with the people who use them.
            Following a holistic innovation process for an area of interest or organization,
            students build an initial business case and apply design thinking and
            creative problem-solving strategies to make innovation a sustainable practice.

            Students are introduced to DSLR cameras and taken beyond simply pointing and clicking.
            By using manual modes and taking advantage of the many features a DSLR camera has
            to offer, students learn the technology, techniques, and theory of photography and
            video through a hands-on approach. By exploring best practices during production,
            students learn to avoid post-production issues.

            The ubiquity of devices of all shapes and sizes means web content can no longer be guaranteed
            to be delivered on a specific platform. Students are introduced to responsive web design,
            using HTML, CSS and modern web standards to build sites that work on any size device.
            Students apply current best practices in web design and coding techniques, including
            accessibility and search engine optimization.

            The creation of digital art requires an understanding of the modern techniques,
            tools and file formats the industry uses. By exploring these, students become
            familiar with the process of planning for and executing digital graphics and design
            ts. Students also examine best practices for file size and format, optimization, and the
            development of assets for use both online and in print.

            Through a hands-on approach to design theory, students learn to be objective rather than subjective about
            good design.
            Students are introduced to fundamental design rules, including principles in layout,
            typography, colour theory, user interfaces and interaction design. Modern industry-standard
            software is used to explore different design styles, methodologies and best practices.
