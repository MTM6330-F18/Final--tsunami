          Design Thinking uses a designer mindset to produce business innovations in products and services,
          with a focus on deep understanding of and empathy with the people who use them.
          Following a holistic innovation process for an area of interest or organization,
          students build an initial business case and apply design thinking and
          creative problem-solving strategies to make innovation a sustainable practice.

          Students are introduced to DSLR cameras and taken beyond simply pointing and clicking.
          By using manual modes and taking advantage of the many features a DSLR camera has
          to offer, students learn the technology, techniques, and theory of photography and
          video through a hands-on approach. By exploring best practices during production,
          students learn to avoid post-production issues.

          good design.
          Students are introduced to fundamental design rules, including principles in layout,
          typography, colour theory, user interfaces and interaction design. Modern industry-standard
          software is used to explore different design styles, methodologies and best practices.

          of HTML and CSS, students use JavaScript and related client-side technologies to build
          interactivity into websites and applications. Best practices in coding are elaborated
          on and put into practice, and students are introduced to core coding concepts including
          functions, conditional statements and loops.

          Content Management Systems (CMS) offer pre-built functionality that designers and
          developers can work with to deliver diverse, feature-rich, modern websites.
          Students learn first-hand how to quickly install, configure, customize and style websites built
          on these systems. In addition, students learn how and when using a CMS is appropriate,
          when it can benefit projects and clients and how to integrate a variety of social media
          systems within their CMS.
