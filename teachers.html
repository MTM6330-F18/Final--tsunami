          I have taught many subjects so probably not. I essentially think of

          confident in my
          skills. Advice for future students: Be open minded and learn how to learn since this is a fast-past and every

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <hr>
        <h4>What courses do you teach?</h4>
        <p>I teach Client-Side Web Development and Server-Side Web Development for the IMD program.</p>
        <h4>Where did you go to school university, college, etc.)?</h4>
        <p> I attended Iowa State University</p>
        <h4>Why did you become a teacher?</h4>
        <p> I am largely self-taught and constantly striving to learn more. The field of web design and development is
          ever-changing and if you don’t keep moving, you will fall behind. It is this realization that lead me to
          start teaching at Algonquin College in January of 2016. I have a passion for learning and it fuels my desire
          to share what I know with others. It has become my new passion, and my primary focus. I aim to be the best
          teacher I can, and it is my hope that my students will find the same spark of curiosity that changed my life
          all those years ago.</p>
        <h4>How many years have you been a teacher?</h4>
        <p>I have been teaching for almost 3 years.</p>
        <h4>Is there anything you wish you taught but can't? </h4>
        <p>
          There are a lot of topics and information I wish I
          could teach. Web Development is a vast field and there is
          so much that can be learned and taught. But unfortunately,
          there is only so much time. But specifically, I would like to teach
          more CSS. I really enjoy how CSS mixes the worlds of logic and design.
        </p>
        <h6>Advice for future students: </h6>
        <p>
          Don’t be afraid of new things and embrace change.
          In this field, things are changing all the time,
          and there is a constant array of new things to learn.
          You can choose to sit by the sidelines or you can be the
          one who is riding the wave.

        <h4>What courses do you teach?</h4>
        <p>
          I teach in both the Interactive Media Design (IMD)
          and Mobile Application Design & Development
        </p>
        <h6>(MAD&D) programs:</h6>
        <p> MTM6330 Web Production (IMD)</p>
        <p> MTM6430 Web Applications (IMD)</p>

        <h4>Where did you go to school university, college, etc.)?</h4>
        <p>
          I have studied at Carleton, Laurier and the school of
          hard knocks ;-)
        </p>
        <h4>Why did you become a teacher?</h4>
        <p>
          My professional career, has always included coaching
          and mentoring components. When the opportunity came up
          to teach at Algonquin this seemed like a natural extension.
          I really enjoy the opportunity to share my knowledge and
          passion for our industry with the next generation of web design
          and development professionals.
        </p>
        <h4>How many years have you been a teacher?</h4>
        <p>
          I have been formally teaching at Algonquin for two years.
          I have been coach colleagues over my whole 30 year career.
        </p>
        <h4>Is there anything you wish you taught but can't? </h4>
        <p>
          I would love to add a special course dedicated to
          implementing web accessibility best practices.
          I think this is an important and often overlooked topic
          in our industry.
        </p>
        <h6>Advice for future students:</h6>
        <p>
          Come with an open mind. Don’t be afraid of what you don’t know -- yet.
          If you are a little uncomfortable, that means that you are learning something new and that is a good thing.
          We can guide you through the learning process, and if you are willing to do the reading and the practice you
          can learn to do anything!
